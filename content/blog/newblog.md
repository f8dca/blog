The old wordpress blog got dated, its maintenance became too much work, the performance was mediocre and there were way to many security problems with it. It lost its lustere and became a chore.

Time to upgrade to something better, leaner, more fun.

When I was thinking about possible replcements it occured to me that I have a very large static web site already available to me, courtesy of my email provider [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com)

My other requirements were:
-  A static single binary for the generator for drop in deployment ( no python , no java, no javascypt , node etc)
-  Fast site generation with live preview
-  Deep git integration
-  Easy deployment pipelines
-  Plain text files based 
-  Markdown & Mermaid.js support
-  Rich ecosystem with plenty of community to support it
-  Open-Source

This effectively narrowed the selection down to one : [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Next question was theme selection. Again I had my criterias for this:
-  Minimalistic
-  White background without any decoration
-  Focusing on small page size

Then I was reading an article by Herman Martinus  over at [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev) that resonated with my thinking:

>  There is a website obesity crisis. Bloated websites are full of scripts, ads, and trackers slowing your readers down every time they try to read your well-crafted content.  
>  
>  Bear is all you need to build a fantastic and optimized site or blog. It works perfectly on **any** viewing device. All you need to focus on is writing good content.  
>  
>  Bear makes it simple to publish content online and grow an audience while keeping pages tiny, fast, and **optimized for search engines.**  
>  
>  Each page is ~5kb.  

So here we are: My new blog is based on the excellent Hugo [BearBlog template](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog)

Stay tuned while I migrate my content from the old wordpress site.
